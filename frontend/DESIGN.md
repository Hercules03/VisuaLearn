# VisuaLearn Frontend Design Document

## 1. Overview
VisuaLearn is a web-based educational tool designed for students (ages 8-15) and educators. The frontend provides a conversational interface where users can request and view educational diagrams generated by AI.

## 2. Design Principles
- **Clarity over Complexity**: Minimalist interface to keep the focus on learning content.
- **Mobile-First**: Primary users (students) will often use tablets or smartphones.
- **Feedback-Rich**: Clear visual indicators for all AI processing stages (Planning, Generating, Reviewing).
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, readable typography, and screen-reader friendly.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18+ (Vite)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context / Hooks (Session-based)

## 4. Visual Identity
- **Primary Color**: #3b82f6 (Blue-500) - Trustworthy and academic.
- **Accent Color**: #10b981 (Emerald-500) - Growth and success.
- **Background**: #f8fafc (Slate-50) - Clean, reduces eye strain.
- **Typography**: 
  - Sans-serif (Inter or Nunito) for readability.
  - Large targets for touch interaction (min 44px).

## 5. Component Architecture

### 5.1 Layout
- `App.tsx`: Main entry point.
- `Layout.tsx`: Responsive container with Header and Footer.

### 5.2 Features
- `ChatContainer.tsx`: Manages the message list and scrolling logic.
- `MessageBubble.tsx`: Renders user and AI messages.
- `DiagramCard.tsx`: Specialized component for rendering the generated diagram with zoom/expand capabilities.
- `ProcessingIndicator.tsx`: Multi-stage progress visualizer (Analyzing -> Planning -> Generating -> Reviewing).
- `InputArea.tsx`: Auto-expanding textarea with "Quick Suggestion" chips.
- `ExportControls.tsx`: Buttons for PNG, SVG, and XML downloads.

## 6. User Flows & States

### 6.1 States
1.  **Idle**: Empty chat with suggestion chips (e.g., "Water Cycle", "Photosynthesis").
2.  **Thinking**: 
    - Text starts streaming if available.
    - Progress stepper shows active backend stage.
3.  **Success**: Diagram rendered with download options.
4.  **Error**: Friendly message with "Retry" option.

### 6.2 Interaction Patterns
- **Zooming**: Clicking a diagram opens a full-screen Modal (`Dialog`) with pan/zoom capability (using `react-quick-pinch-zoom`).
- **Exporting**: Instant feedback when a download is triggered.

## 7. MVP Roadmap
- [x] **Sprint 1**: Setup Vite, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui. Basic layout.
- [x] **Sprint 2**: Chat UI with streaming text support.
- [x] **Sprint 3**: Diagram rendering component and export functionality.
- [x] **Sprint 4**: Polish (Animations, Transitions, Mobile optimization).
