# **App Name**: VisuaLearn

## Core Features:

- Interactive Diagram Generation: Generates interactive, animated SVG diagrams explaining complex concepts based on user input using Gemini's coding capabilities. Uses a tool to determine the information necessary for clarity and retention.
- Component Highlighting and Tooltips: Highlights key components on hover and displays tooltips with concise definitions.
- Step-by-Step Tutorial: Implements 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons for a step-by-step breakdown of the concept. Features phase indicators and dynamic text descriptions.
- Full Simulation Mode: Offers a 'Start/Stop Simulation' toggle to loop the animation, demonstrating the concept in real-time with active component highlighting.
- User Input: Allows users to input the thing that the user wants to learn (e.g. "air-conditionor", "asymmetric algorithm", "load balancer", etc.)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#483D8B) for a professional and educational feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, for a clean, uncluttered look.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#70A1AF) to provide visual interest without distracting from the learning process.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptions, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, to combine a techy feel with readability.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different components and functions within the diagrams.
- Responsive layout to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes. Clear separation of the diagram, tutorial steps, and simulation controls.
- Smooth, subtle animations to guide the user through each step and maintain engagement.
