Consider adding a 'Received Encrypted Message' node or clearly showing 'Network/Insecure Channel' leading into 'Decryption Process' or the existing 'Encrypted Message (Ciphertext)' node if it's meant to represent the received message.",
      "Improve the routing of arrows, especially 'Network/Insecure Channel \u2192 Bob (Receiver)' (`rel11`), 'Bob's Public Key \u2192 Alice (Sender)' (`rel4`), and 'Encrypted Message (Ciphertext) \u2192 Decryption Process' (`rel13`), to be more direct and less disruptive to the overall sequence flow."
