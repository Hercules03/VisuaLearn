      "Consider adjusting the 'delivers Ciphertext (to Bob)' label on the edge from 'Secure Communication Channel' to 'Decryption Algorithm' to be more concise, as the ciphertext being an input to the decryption algorithm is already explicitly shown by another edge ('is input to') and Bob's involvement is implicit at this stage. A simpler label like 'delivers ciphertext' or 'transmits' would suffice."
