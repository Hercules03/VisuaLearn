      "**Clarify Data Transmission and Reception**: Modify the diagram to explicitly show `Ciphertext`, `Digital Signature`, and `Plaintext Data` (used for verification) *exiting* the `Communication Channel` before being input into their respective decryption or verification processes. This can be achieved by creating new 'received' components (e.g., 'Ciphertext (Received)') that are targets of edges from the 'Communication Channel', and then these 'received' components become inputs to the relevant processes.",
      "**Add Key Possession Relationship for Bob**: Include an explicit arrow from 'Bob's Private Key' (id=8) to 'Bob (Receiver)' (id=4) with a label like 'Kept secret by' to mirror the relationship for Alice's private key."
