      "Asymmetric encryption uses a 'public key' for encryption (which can be shared widely) and a 'private key' for decryption (which must be kept secret).",
      "The security of asymmetric encryption relies on the computational difficulty of deriving the private key from the public key.",
      "This method enables secure communication over insecure channels without prior shared secrets, solving the key exchange problem.",
      "While often slower than symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption is crucial for initial secure key exchange and digital signatures."
